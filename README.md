## 🧮 Default Assumptions

| Material        | Assumption                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Bricks          | 1,350 Nos per 100 Cft (includes wastage) |
| Cement          | 50 kg = 1.25 Cft                         |
| Wall Plaster    | ½ inch (12 mm)                           |
| Ceiling Plaster | ⅜ inch (10 mm)                           |
